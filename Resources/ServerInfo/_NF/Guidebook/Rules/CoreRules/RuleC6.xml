[color=#ffff00][head=3]Section 6: Roleplay Rules[/head][/color]

[color=#a4885c]6.1[/color] Your character is a separate entity from you, the player. Your character's actions, feelings, and knowledge in-game should be based solely on the character's experiences rather than your own as the player. *1

[color=#a4885c]6.2[/color] Do not play excessively hostile or provocative characters. Playing a character accurately should never result in rulebreaks.  - Ahelp for any questions relating to this. *1

[color=#a4885c]6.3[/color] If you choose a job on shift, you are required to participate in the round as said job when necessary. *1

[color=#a4885c]6.4[/color] Do not intentionally break roleplay to gain an unfair advantage while someone is typing. *1

[color=#a4885c]6.5[/color][color=#00fffb] Respect other people's consent, dignity and boundaries. IF SOMEBODY ASKS YOU TO STOP BOTHERING THEM LOOC (local-out-of-character), do so. If this rule is abused, Ahelp right away. [/color]*2
